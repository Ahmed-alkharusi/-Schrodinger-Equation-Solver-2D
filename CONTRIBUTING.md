# Here are some ideas to improve the code:
```
1. using GPU instead of CPU to run the code or using libraries such as Numba to accelerate the code;
```
```
2. extending the code to solve the TDSE (Time-dependent Schrodinger Equation);
```
```
3. extending the code to solve 3D equations. However, for high resolutions this might be computationally extensive;
```
```
4. adding a GUI (Graphical user interface);
```
```
5. adding functions to analyse the results further. For example, plotting the energy spacing distribution of the eigenstates;
